PROOF Of The PUDDING IS IN THE EATING -grann-

A few days ago I had a call from the House Keeping Manger of a leading 5Star hotel in Colombo.

One of their best Rooms wasn't rented for 3 months. she said;

"There is a terrible lingering small coming from the Carpet and now that is in the AC too. We did all we can and sprayed tons of chemicals. We heard you inspect without charges. Can you please take a look and see what you can do?"

Thrilled that we were called, an inspection was done within hours.

We gave our proposal with a promise not to change if the smell appeared within a week.

Our micro team worked for 4 hours a day for 3 days. The smell was no more. House Keeping & Guest Relations Manager were satisfied enough to let the room.

After one week we got paid. We did 6 more hours and guests moved in for 4days. 

The family that stayed had a pleasant stay and extended for 3 more days and left for home a few hours ago.

We are proud our Process worked. Now every time a guest leaves their special rooms we get to sanitize and purify these rooms for just enough hours.

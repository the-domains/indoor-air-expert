**PROOF Of The PUDDING IS IN THE EATING** -granny-

A few days ago I had a call from the House Keeping Manger of a leading 5Star hotel in Colombo.

One of their best Rooms wasn't rented for 3 months.

She said; "There is a terrible, lingering smell coming from the Carpet and now that is in the AC too. We did all we can and sprayed tons of chemicals". "We heard you inspect without charges. Can you please take a look and see what you can do?"

We were Thrilled to be called, and the inspection was done within hours.

We gave our proposal with a promise not to change if the smell appeared within a week. Our micro team worked for 4 hours a day for 3 days. The smell was no more.

House Keeping & Guest Relations Managers were satisfied enough to let the room. We did 6 more hours and Guests moved in for 4days.

After one week we got paid.

The family that rented the room had a pleasant time and extended theirstay for 3 more days. They left for home a few hours ago, after a 1 week stay.

We are proud our Process worked. Now every time a guest leaves their special, high end rooms we get to sanitize and purify these rooms for just enough hours. Guests really don't notice much. Hotel keepers are pleased with the reesults.

Clean is the natural way!
